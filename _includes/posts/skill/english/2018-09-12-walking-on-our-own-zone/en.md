***New York is 3 hours ahead of California,***

***but it does not make California slow.***

***Someone graduated at the age of 22,***

***but waited 5 years before securing a good job!***

***Someone became a CEO at 25, and died at 50.***

***While another became a CEO at 50, and lived to 90 years.***

***Someone is still single, while someone else got married.***

***Obama retires at 55, but Trump starts at 70.***

***Absolutely everyone in this world works based on their time zone.***

***People around you might seem to go ahead of you,***

***some might seem to be behind you.***

***But everyone is running their own race, in their own time.***

***Don't envy them or mock them.***

***They are in their time zone, and you are in yours!***

***Life is about waiting for the right moment to act.***

***So, relax. You're not late. You're not early.***

***You are very much on time,***

***and in your time zone destiny set up for you.***

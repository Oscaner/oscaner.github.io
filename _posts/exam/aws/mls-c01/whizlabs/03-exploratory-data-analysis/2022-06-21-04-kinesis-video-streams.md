- Automatically provisions and scales infrastructure to read streaming media
- Producers such as web cams, security cameras, audio feeds, images
    - Securely stream video using the Kinesis Video Streams SDK
- Storage
    - Kinesis Video Streams ingests the stream data, stores, encrypts, and indexes the stream for either real-time or batch analytics
- Consumers
    - Real-time or batch machine learning applications
    - Video processing or playback services

## In Machine Learning

- Facial recognition
    - Facial analytics using machine learning services and algorithms such as the SageMaker built-in )image Classification algorithm or the Rekognition service
- Object detection
    - Object identification algorithm to detect when certain objects appear in the stream
- Computer vision and video analytics using machine learning frameworks such as Apache MxNet, TensorFlow, and OpenCV
- Smart home/city applications
    - Home surveillance, Red light cams
- Industrial automation
    - Predictive maintenance using MxNet, TensorFlow, and OpenCV

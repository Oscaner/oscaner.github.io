## Defined

![[defined-forecasting.png]]

- Supervised learning algorithm that forecasts one-dimensional (scalar) time series using recurrent neural networks (RNN)
- Trains a single model jointly over all of the similar time series in your dataset
- Use your trained model to create forecasts for new time series that are similar to the ones on which it was trained
- Training input is one or more target time series that have been generated by the same process or similar processes
- Uses an approximation of the process(es) and predicts how the target time series evolves

## Use Cases

1. Forecasting global food demand
2. Predicting global temperature
3. Predicting fast-food queues
4. Predicting rainfall
5. Predicting stock prices
6. Options pricing
7. Disease progression
8. Supply chain management

## SageMaker Algorithms

### DeepAR

- Uses a training dataset and an optional test dataset
- Use a trained model to predict forecasts for the future of the time series in the training set, or for other time series
- Automatically derives time series based on the frequency of the target series
    - For example: a day series generates `day-of-week`, `day-of-month`, `day-of-year`
- Can predict "what if ?" scenarios, such as, what if I change/broaden the distribution of my product ?
- Builds a single model for all time-series and tries to identify similarities across them
- Important Hyperparameters
    - `context_length`: the number of time-points that the mode gets to see before making the prediction
    - `epochs`: the maximum number of passes over the training data
    - `prediction_length`: the number of time-steps that the model is trained to predict, also called the forecast horizon
    - `time_freq`: the granularity of the time series in the dataset

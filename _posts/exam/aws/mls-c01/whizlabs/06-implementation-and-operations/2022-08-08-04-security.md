## SageMaker Instances

### Jupyter Notebook

![[secure-jupyter-notebook.png]]

- Your SageMaker infrastructure uses EC2 instances dedicated for your use
- Can map your SageMaker resources to VPC so you can use your network controls
- Control access to your jupyter notebooks and your hasted models through IAM
- Can only access your SageMaker resources from within your VPC using your VPC Endpoints (Private Connectivity)
- Encrypt your data at rest and in flight from your datasets on S3 to your notebooks and through to your hosted endpoints
- You can use lifecycle configurations to harden the OS of your SageMaker EC2 instances or install agents
- SageMaker is integrated with CloudWatch and CloudTrail for logging training job and hosted model activity as well as API calls

### Jobs and Endpoints

![[secure-job-and-endpoint.png]]

- Can map your training, tuning, and hosted model endpoint instances to VPC so you can use your network controls
- Can restrict your training, tuning, and endpoint instances to resources within your VPC using your VPC Endpoints (Private Connectivity)

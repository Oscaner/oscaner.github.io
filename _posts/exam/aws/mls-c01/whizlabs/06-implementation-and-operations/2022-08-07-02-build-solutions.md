## Toolset

![[ml-toolset.png]]

- SageMaker makes it simple to develop high quality models by enabling quick deployment at scale
- SageMaker provides the tools needed for machine learning in a single toolset that allows you to get models to production faster with much less effort and at lower cost than with the traditional tool suite
    - SageMaker Studio
    - SageMaker Autopilot
    - SageMaker Experiments
    - SageMaker Debugger
    - SageMaker Model Monitor

## Build with SageMaker Studio

Single, web-based visual interface where you can perform all your machine learning development steps

- Build, train, and deploy models
- Upload data, create new notebooks, train and tune models, move back and forth between steps to adjust experiments, compare results, and deploy models to production

## Performance with SageMaker Autopilot

Build, train, and tune models with complete visibility and control

- Inspects input data, applies feature engineering, picks optimum set of algorithms, trains and tunes multiple models, tracks model's performance, and ranks your models based on their performance
- Gives you the best model for your problem at hand while saving time
- Can be used by developers without extensive machine learning experience

## Evaluate with SageMaker Experiments

Organize your artifacts, track metrics, and evaluate training runs using SageMaker Experiments

- Manage your model iterations by capturing the input parameters, configurations, and results, and saving them as experiments

## Fault Tolerance with SageMaker

Analyze, identify, and alert problems for machine learning

- Track real-time metrics when training such as validation, confusion matrices, and learning gradients to increase mode accuracy
- Generate warnings and corrective action advice when you experience training issues

## Resiliency with SageMaker Monitor

Detect and remediate concept drift where the patterns used to train the model have changed over time

- Identifies concept drift in deployed models and gives detailed notifications that help identify the source of the drift

## Data Engineering

Seven steps to prepare you data for use in a machine learning model

1. Gather your data
2. Handle missing data
3. Feature extraction
4. Decide which features are important
5. Encode categorical values
6. Numeric feature engineering
7. Split your data into training and testing datasets

## Exploratory Data Analysis
